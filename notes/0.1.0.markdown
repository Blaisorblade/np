Initial release. Provides a minimal interface for generating new sbt projects via,... sbt.

Basic use is to install the plugin global an start up a new project with

    $ sbt
    $ np name:my-project org:com.mypackage version:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT

This will generate a simple `build.sbt` project for you along with the standard project directory structure for main and test sources.
